* What is Emacs?
  - Emacs is a Lisp programming environment.
  - ...which happens to be good for editing things.
  - Notes for going through this file:
    + If you see C-x :: this means that you should hold down the Ctrl
         Key and press x.
    + If you see M-x :: this means that you should hold down the Meta
         Key (more on what this is in the next point) and press x.
  - You should remap your Caps Lock key to become your Ctrl Key. You
    can do this by going to:
    *System Preferences* -> *Keyboard* -> *Modifier Keys*
    -> _Change Caps Lock key to mean Ctrl_
  - This configuration sets your Cmd key to be the Meta key inside
    Emacs. So every time you are supposed to press the Meta key, you
    should press the Cmd key.
  - You should remap your Lock Screen shortcut in Mac to free up
    =C-M-q=. This is a critical shortcut for Lisp programming in
    Emacs.
    + Launch System Preferences and go to the Keyboard pane.
    + Select the 'Shortcuts' tab.
    + From the list on the left, select 'App Shortcuts'.
    + Click on the plus (+) button below to add your new shortcut.
    + In the dialog box we'll want to leave 'All Applications'
      selected in the first menu. Enter 'Lock Screen' as the Menu
      Title. Please note this has to be exactly the same name for this
      to work. (It has to do with Automator entries in Mac). Finally,
      enter your keyboard shortcut. Let's go with Option+Shift+Q
    + Click Add and you're all done!

* A more important question: Why should you care?
  You should care because the editor is one of the core tools you will
  employ when programming. You will spend a large amount of your time
  inside an editor. Therefore, you should choose a powerful editor and
  master it.

* Getting started with Emacs: Problems
  - Completely different terminology.
  - Unfamiliarity with configuration systems.
    - Also, unfamiliarity with Lisp in general and elisp is particular.
  - Lack of a comprehensive beginner guide outside of Emacs.
  - Emacs defaults are not optimal.
    - ...though it is getting better with every release.

* Starter Kits vs Starting from scratch
  - Without knowing how Emacs loads configuration, understanding
    existing configuration is hard.
  - Too hard to figure out where to start.
  - We are going to fix that!

* What is my 'init' file?
  - ~/.emacs.d/init.el
  - This loads extra config over the defaults when you start Emacs.

* Basic Operations
  - C-x C-f :: ~find-file~ Opens a file for editing.
  - C-x C-s :: ~save-buffer~ Saves changes to disk.
  - C-x C-c :: ~save-buffers-kill-terminal~ Exits Emacs
  - C-x k :: ~kill-buffer~ Close a file

* Terminology
  - Buffers
  - Windows
  - Frames
  - Other oddities
    - Killing
    - Yanking

* A little theory: Modes
  - Major Mode
  - Minor Modes
  - Composability

* Helping yourself
  - C-h :: The Great Emacs Self-Help system.
  - <keybinding> C-h :: All bindings available within the specified
    prefix binding.
  - C-h f :: (function) Display documentation for the given function.
  - C-h k :: (keys) Display the full documentation for the key sequence.
  - C-h v :: (variable) Display the given variable's documentation and value.
  - C-h w :: (command) Display which keystrokes invoke the given command (where-is).
  - C-h P :: (package) Describe the given Emacs Lisp package.
  - C-h p :: (topic) Find packages matching a given topic keyword.
  - C-h t :: Comprehensive Emacs tutorial for getting started with Emacs.

* Movement
** Step, Step, Step
   - C-f :: ~forward-char~
   - C-b :: ~backward-char~
   - C-n :: ~next-line~
   - C-p :: ~previous-line~
   - M-f :: ~forward-word~
   - M-b :: ~backward-word~
   - M-n :: advancing options (will be demo'd later)
   - M-p :: retreating options (will be demo'd later)

** More?
   Emacs understands semantic groups.  Commands:
   - C-a   :: ~beginning-of-line~
   - C-e   :: ~end-of-line~
   - M-a   :: ~backward-sentence~
   - M-e   :: ~forward-sentence~
   - C-M-f :: ~forward-sexp~
   - C-M-b :: ~backward-sexp~
   - C-M-a :: ~beginning-of-defun~
   - C-M-e :: ~end-of-defun~
   - M-m   :: ~back-to-indentation~

** What if you want to move N times?
   The Optional Argument: Augument the behaviour of your functions.
   - C-u     :: ~universal-argument~
   - C-u <N> :: do this ~N~times (The N stands for a digit value)
   - M-<N>   :: a shortcut to C-u <N>

** Directional Editing aka Driving in Reverse
   - M-- :: ~negative-argument~
   - Favorite places of using this:
     + M-c :: ~capitalize-word~
     + M-l :: ~downcase-word~
     + M-u :: ~upcase-word~

** Final Notes
   Optional and negative arguments are extremely powerful, and enable
   surprisingly powerful movement. Be sure to try out these arguments
   on the commands you regularly use.

* Finding things
** Jump to a point by searching for it.
   This is a ton of text I don't care about:

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
    eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
    enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
    nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
    reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat
    nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident,
    sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

   I'd rather be here:

   - C-s :: ~isearch-forward-regexp~
   - C-r :: ~isearch-backward-regexp~
   - isearch-lazy-highlight
   - C-s :: ~isearch-repeat-forward~
   - C-r :: ~isearch-repeat-backward~
   - C-w :: ~isearch-yank-word-or-char~
   - C-y :: ~isearch-yank-kill~

** A segue into History: The Mark and the Point
   - What is a mark?
   - What is a point?
   - What is a region?
   - Jumping to marks
     - C-SPC     :: ~set-mark-command~ (Drops a mark)
     - C-u C-SPC :: (Jumps to previously dropped mark)
     - C-x C-SPC :: ~pop-global-mark~
   - How this ties into search: All non-deterministic movement drops a mark that can be followed back

** Searching Redux : Occur
   - M-s o :: ~occur~

** A segue into Composability: next-error and prev-error
   This minor mode is auto activated for any Results buffer: compilation, grep, occur are some examples.

   - M-g M-n :: ~next-error~
   - M-g M-p :: ~prev-error~

** Searching Redux : Grep
   Emacs implementation of Unix Grep
   - M-x rgrep

* Editing
** Basics
   - C-d :: ~delete-char~
   - M-d :: ~kill-word~
   - C-k :: ~kill-line~
   - C-w :: ~kill-region~
   - C-y :: ~yank~
   - M-y :: ~yank-pop~
   - M-w :: ~kill-ring-save~

** Semantic Killing
   - M-k   :: ~kill-sentence~
   - C-M-k :: ~kill-sexp~

** Regions and Rectangles
   - C-w     :: ~kill-region~
   - C-x r k :: ~kill-rectangle~

** A segue into Rings
   - What are rings?
   - kill-ring, mark-ring, undo-ring, blah blah blah

** query-replace-regex
   - M-x query-replace-regex

* Levelling up
** Ido: Candidates for Completion
   Interactive-do : The inbuilt super powerful completion and
   suggestion feature.

   - C-s   :: ~ido-next-match~
   - C-r   :: ~ido-prev-match~
   - C-SPC :: ~ido-restrict-to-matches~

** Imenu : Suggestions for places to Jump to
   - M-x imenu

** A segue into temporary and permanent markers
   - Registers
     + C-x r SPC :: ~point-to-register~
     + C-x r j   :: ~jump-to-register~
     + C-x r s   :: ~copy-to-register~
     + C-x r i   :: ~insert-register~
   - Bookmarks
     + C-x r m   :: ~bookmark-set~
     + C-x r b   :: ~bookmark-jump~
     + C-x r l   :: ~bookmark-list~

** Helm : More completion and suggestion
   - C-x c :: the default helm prefix key
   - C-x c i :: ~helm-semantic-or-imenu~ (Access imenu via helm)
   - M-y :: ~helm-show-kill-ring~ (Access the kill-ring via helm)
   - C-x c r b :: ~helm-filtered-bookmarks~ (Access bookmarks via helm)
   - C-x c r i :: ~helm-register~ (Access registers via helm)
   - C-x c C-b :: ~helm-mini~ (Buffer and File selector via helm)

** Avy: Jumping elsewhere
   - M-g g :: ~avy-goto-line~ (Jump to line start or line number)
   - M-g SPC :: ~avy-goto-word-1~ (Jump to a word by typing start CHAR)

* Lispy Editing with Paredit
   Open a clojure or emacs lisp file to try these commands out:
   - ( :: opening brackets - excellent example of digit keys
   - C-) :: ~paredit-forward-slurp-sexp~
        #+begin_example
          (foo (bar |baz) quux zot)
            ->
          (foo (bar |baz quux) zot)
        #+end_example
   - C-( :: ~paredit-backward-slurp-sexp~
        #+begin_example
          (foo bar (baz| quux) zot)
            ->
          (foo (bar baz| quux) zot)
        #+end_example
   - C-} :: ~paredit-forward-barf-sexp~
        #+begin_example
          (foo (bar |baz quux) zot)
            ->
          (foo (bar |baz) quux zot)
        #+end_example
   - C-{ :: ~paredit-backward-barf-sexp~
        #+begin_example
          (foo (bar baz |quux) zot)
            ->
          (foo bar (baz |quux) zot)
        #+end_example
   - @TODO :: entering and exiting
   - @TODO :: splicing
