* Introduction
  ~emacs-up~ is a bare-bones, quick-start Emacs configuration. It is
  meant to get newcomers started and productive with Emacs and
  contains the minimal configuration required to satisfy employee asks
  inside Helpshift. ~emacs-up~ is currently configured for Clojure
  programming only, but I'm hoping that it will soon be expanded to
  include other programming languages used within Helpshift.

* Installation
  - The minimum supported Emacs version for this configuration is
    Emacs 25. You can install Emacs 25 through Homebrew as follows:
    #+begin_example
      $ brew install emacs
    #+end_example
  - Out of the box, ~emacs-up~ supports development on Clojure
    versions ~1.7~ and above. If you are someone who has to program
    against Clojure 1.6 or older versions, refer to the section below
    this one on instructions to do that.
  - Clone ~emacs-up~ to your machine as your ~.emacs.d~ folder.
    #+begin_example
      $ git clone https://github.com/helpshift/emacs-up.git ~/.emacs.d
    #+end_example
  - Create a ~.lein/profiles.clj~ file in your home directory.
    + The contents of the file should be as follows:
      #+begin_src clojure
        {:repl {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.17.0"]]
                          [refactor-nrepl "2.4.0"]]
                :dependencies [^:replace [org.clojure/tools.nrepl "0.2.12"]]}}
      #+end_src
    + You don't need the cider-nrepl or refactor-nrepl plugin section
      if you use ~cider-jack-in~ to start your REPL and connect to it.
      We don't use ~cider-jack-in~ at Helpshift, for reasons outside
      the scope of this document.
    + Changes will not apply to REPLs that are already running. After
      creating the ~profiles.clj~ file, you need to stop and restart
      running REPLs.
  - Fire up Emacs and wait for it to download packages (This is a
    one-time thing).
  - The ~helm-ag~ package in this config depends on Ag - The Silver
    Searcher. Installing Ag will allow you to levarage super fast
    searches on files and data from within Emacs. Installing this is
    optional, not installing it will mean that only ~helm-ag~ will
    cease to work. You can find instructions to install Ag here:
    https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher. Install it from
    Homebrew with:
    #+begin_example
      $ brew install the_silver_searcher
    #+end_example
  - (For beginners) Go through the tutorial in the ~docs/~ folder to
    get started.

* Developing against Clojure 1.6 and older versions
  If you are developing against Clojure 1.6 or earlier, you need to
  install older packages of CIDER, Clj-Refactor and Clojure
  mode. Don't worry, I have you covered here.
  - Open the file ~hs-clj-packages.el~ - at the top level in this
    repository - and modify the value against ~use-older-clj-versions~
    from ~nil~ to ~t~. (This is the first line of code in the file, so
    it's at the very top).
  - Create a ~.lein/profiles.clj~ file in your home directory.
    + The contents of the file should be as follows:
      #+begin_src clojure
        {:repl {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.10.2"]
                          [refactor-nrepl "1.1.0"]]
                :dependencies [^:replace [org.clojure/tools.nrepl "0.2.12"]]}}
      #+end_src
    + Changes will not apply to REPLs that are already running. After
      creating the ~profiles.clj~ file, you need to stop and restart
      running REPLs.
  - Fire up / Restart your Emacs and wait for it to download packages
    (This is a one-time thing).

* Updating Emacs Up
  The current version of ~emacs-up~ is ~v2.0.1~. If you are updating
  an existing installation of ~emacs-up~, the ~NEWS.org~ file lists
  major changes and update instructions.

* Happy Programming! May the force be with you.
